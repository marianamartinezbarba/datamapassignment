<p>High pollution rates in New York accelerate as the city deals with the consequences of climate change. Average PM 2.5 levels in South Williamsburg, for example, were 38% higher than the neighborhood average according to the <a href="https://nyc-eja.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CAMP-EJ-2020-Report-Final-021821-Reduced.pdf">NYC Environmental Justice Alliance</a>. The same report shows that some the highest pollution points in Brooklyn are near the BQE trains and the Williamsburg Bridge, two of the largest transportation routes in the city. </p>

<p>South Williamsburg organization El Puente has been documenting PM levels for decades, even publishing research with Queens College. Environmental expert and member Daniela Castillo notes, “The BQE runs through our neighborhood, resulting in effects on public health, safety, and wellness.” Moreover, areas such South Williamsburg account for approximately <a href="https://statisticalatlas.com/neighborhood/New-York/New-York/Williamsburg/Race-and-Ethnicity">25.8% Latinos</a>. Currently, the neighborhood ranks "worst" in asthma rates and air quality documented by the <a href= "https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/beta/neighborhood-reports/williamsburg_bushwick/asthma_and_the_environment/">Environnmental and Health Data Portal</a>. According to the map's findings the highest concentrations of PM 2.5 levels in Brooklyn are in Williamsburg. </p>
